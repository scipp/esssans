    """
    Prepare monitor data for computing the transmission fraction.
    The input data are first converted to wavelength (if needed).
    If a ``non_background_range`` is provided, it defines the region where data is
    considered not to be background, and regions outside are background. A mean
    background level will be computed from the background and will be subtracted from
    the non-background counts.
    Finally, if wavelength bins are provided, the data is rebinned to match the
    requested binning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    monitor:
        The monitor to be pre-processed.
    wavelength_bins:
        The binning in wavelength to use for the rebinning.
    non_background_range:
        The range of wavelengths that defines the data which does not constitute
        background. Everything outside this range is treated as background counts.
    uncertainties:
        The mode for broadcasting uncertainties. See
        :py:class:`ess.reduce.uncertainty.UncertaintyBroadcastMode` for details.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        The input monitors converted to wavelength, cleaned of background counts, and
        rebinned to the requested wavelength binning.
