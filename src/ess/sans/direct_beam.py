    """
    Compute the direct beam function.

    Procedure:

    The idea behind the direct beam iterations is to determine an efficiency of the
    detectors as a function of wavelength.
    To calculate this, it is possible to compute $I(Q)$ for the full wavelength range,
    and for individual slices (bands) of the wavelength range.
    If the direct beam function used in the $I(Q)$ computation is correct, then $I(Q)$
    curves for the full wavelength range and inside the bands should overlap.

    We require two pipelines, one for the full wavelength range and one for the bands.

    The steps are as follows:

     1. Create a flat direct beam function, as a function of wavelength, with
        wavelength bins corresponding to the wavelength bands
     2. Calculate inside each band by how much one would have to multiply the final
        $I(Q)$ so that the curve would overlap with the full range curve
     3. Multiply the direct beam values inside each wavelength band by this factor
     4. Compare the full-range $I(Q)$ to a theoretical reference and add the
        corresponding additional scaling to the direct beam function
     5. Iterate a given number of times (typically less than 10) so as to gradually
        converge on a direct beam function

    TODO: For simplicity and robustness, we currently specify the number of times to
    iterate. We could imagine in the future having a convergence criterion instead to
    determine when to stop iterating.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pipeline:
        The pipeline to compute the differential scattering cross section I(Q).
    I0:
        The intensity of the I(Q) for the known sample at the lowest Q value.
    niter:
        The number of iterations to perform.
