    """
    Generate a coordinate transformation graph for SANS elastic scattering.

    It is based on classical conversions from ``tof`` and pixel ``position`` to
    :math:`\\lambda` (``wavelength``), :math:`\\theta` (``theta``) and
    :math:`Q` (``Q``), but can take into account the Earth's gravitational field,
    which bends the flight path of the neutrons, to compute the scattering angle
    :math:`\\theta`.

    The angle can be found using the following expression
    (`Seeger & Hjelm 1991 <https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889891004764>`_):

    .. math::

       \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{ x^{2} + \\left( y + \\frac{g m_{\\rm n}}{2 h^{2}} \\lambda^{2} L_{2}^{2} \\right)^{2} } }{L_{2}}\\right)

    where :math:`x` and :math:`y` are the spatial coordinates of the pixels in the
    horizontal and vertical directions, respectively,
    :math:`m_{\\rm n}` is the neutron mass,
    :math:`L_{2}` is the distance between the sample and a detector pixel,
    :math:`g` is the acceleration due to gravity,
    and :math:`h` is Planck's constant.

    By default, the effects of gravity on the neutron flight paths are not included
    (equivalent to :math:`g = 0` in the expression above).

    ----------
