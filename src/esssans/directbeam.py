    Compute the direct beam function.

    Procedure:

    The idea behind the direct beam iterations is to determine an efficiency of the
    detectors as a function of wavelength.
    To calculate this, it is possible to compute $I(Q)$ for the full wavelength range,
    and for individual slices (bands) of the wavelength range.
    If the direct beam function used in the $I(Q)$ computation is correct, then $I(Q)$
    curves for the full wavelength range and inside the bands should overlap.

    We require two pipelines, one for the full wavelength range and one for the bands.

    The steps are as follows:

     1. Create a flat direct beam function, as a function of wavelength, with
        wavelength bins corresponding to the wavelength bands
     2. Calculate inside each band by how much one would have to multiply the final
        $I(Q)$ so that the curve would overlap with the full range curve
     3. Multiply the direct beam values inside each wavelength band by this factor
     4. Compare the full-range $I(Q)$ to a theoretical reference and add the
        corresponding additional scaling to the direct beam function
     5. Iterate until the changes to the direct beam function become small

    Parameters
    ----------
    pipelines:
        List of two pipelines, one for the full wavelength range and one for the bands.
        The order in which the pipelines are given does not matter.
    I0:
        The intensity of the I(Q) for the known sample at the lowest Q value.
    niter:
        The number of iterations to perform.
