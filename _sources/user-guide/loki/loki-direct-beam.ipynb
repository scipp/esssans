    "# Direct beam iterations for LoKI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to compute the direct beam function for the [LoKI](https://europeanspallationsource.se/instruments/loki) detectors.\n",
    "It uses data recorded during the detector test at the Larmor instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the procedure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the direct beam iterations is to determine an efficiency of the detectors as a function of wavelength.\n",
    "To calculate this, it is possible to compute $I(Q)$ for the full wavelength range, and for individual slices (bands) of the wavelength range.\n",
    "If the direct beam function used in the $I(Q)$ computation is correct, then $I(Q)$ curves for the full wavelength range and inside the bands should overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a workflow to compute $I(Q)$ inside a set of wavelength bands (the number of wavelength bands will be the number of data points in the final direct beam function)\n",
    "1. Create a flat direct beam function, as a function of wavelength, with wavelength bins corresponding to the wavelength bands\n",
    "1. Calculate inside each band by how much one would have to multiply the final $I(Q)$ so that the curve would overlap with the full-range curve\n",
    "   (we compute the full-range data by making a copy of the workflow but setting only a single wavelength band that contains all wavelengths)\n",
    "1. Multiply the direct beam values inside each wavelength band by this factor\n",
    "1. Compare the full-range $I(Q)$ to a theoretical reference and add the corresponding additional scaling to the direct beam function\n",
    "1. Iterate until the changes to the direct beam function become small"
